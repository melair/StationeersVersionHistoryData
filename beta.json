This is similar to setting a value using the labeller on memory. This is a much faster (and more specific) way of setting a value on the device than clicking the wheel to move it.",

This UV light is toggleable on and off as it draws a lot of power. It also provides data on it's four slots, providing Growth state, efficiency, health, and the Hash of what kind of plant is inserted. Water should be provided via the pipe, everything else is gathered from the atmosphere around the station. Internal atmosphere (water) is exposed via the logic system also.",

The prime example is linking it with any fabricator, and the display will show a thumbnail of what is selected as the current recipe. It could be set to read a Logic unit such as a Reader, which is in turn set to read from the Arc Furnace Export Slot Hash, which would render a picture of the current Ingot type being produced.",

Now logic mirrors can only reference other logic mirrors so long as they don't already reference it.

All variables of that device are then mirrored on this device, allowing you to mirror the logic state of devices between different networks. You are able to both read and write to the mirrored device. If the logic mirror is not powered, it will return no data and will not allow setting data. The logic mirror itself will be completely hidden to the logic system, as it's purpose is only to mirror. It is buildable off the Logic I/O Kit.",

        "Changed Product Code read/write on fabricators to RecipeHash.",
        "Added logic reading of contents of Import and Export slots. Now can read the contents using ImportSlotHash and ExportSlotHash. Each type of item has a unique hash. A gold ingot in a slot would give a hash of 226410516. This means you can check if the contents of an export or import slot is of a certain type, and then implement logic accordingly.",
        "Fixed insidious bug with Approximately implementation that resulted in large numbers in logic system not being correctly managed.",
        "Changed Logic system to use \"double\" precision as a base, rather than \"float\", due to precision issues. Devices still tend to use floats for implementation. Some devices will be moved to double (such as energy) due to precision issues. These issues remain and will be fixed when this is changed.",
        "Added Logic reading and writing of current product code to basic fabricators (printers). You can now read the \"product code\" which will give you an integer that is a reference to that product. You can store this value easily in memory using a Logic Reader. When you subsequently \"write\" that value back, as a Product code again, it will set that printer to that recipe. This allow you to automatically control what a printer is producing, and potentially make automated factories."

KNOWN ISSUE: They will not work as expected on motherships. Next update will ensure they work correctly on motherships.",
